# COVID-19 Data Visualization Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code for a comprehensive data visualization project on COVID-19's impact in the United States. The project aims to present a clear and interactive representation of various COVID-19 metrics, including cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and vaccinations.

### Main File: `combine.html`

`combine.html` is the central file of this project, serving as the presentation layer that integrates various parts of the visualization. It provides a holistic view of the data and interactive elements to engage users in exploring the COVID-19 impact across different dimensions.

### Component Visualizations

The project consists of three key visualizations, each detailed in separate HTML files:

1. **Cases and Deaths Visualization (`cases_deaths.html`):** This file presents an interactive line graph showcasing the daily and cumulative cases and deaths due to COVID-19.

2. **Hospital Admissions by Age (`admission_by_age.html`):** An age-wise breakdown of hospital admissions is visualized in this file, providing insights into how different age groups were affected.

3. **State-Level Impact (`maps_by_county.html`):** This visualization focuses on the state-level impact of COVID-19, represented through various interactive maps.
